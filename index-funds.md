# Saving for retirement as a form of climate action

## TL;DR

Consider investing your money into index funds that vote your shares for the climate. Doing so allows 
you to vote hundreds of times per year on climate issues. My two favorite funds which proxy your
shareholder rights are the [Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund](https://www.oursphere.org/the-index#?index)
(`$SPFFX`) and the [Engine No. 1 Transform 500 Fund](https://etf.engine1.com/vote/) (`$VOTE`). 
Both of these funds offer low expense ratios and roughly track the S&P 500. My personal preference 
favors `$SPFFX` over `$VOTE`. 

## Introduction

Your retirement nest egg is likely voting against the climate _hundreds of times_ per year.
Retirement fund options, like Vanguard's mutual funds, overwhelmingly vote how company
management recommends. As you might expect, management recommendations are often
diametrically opposed to what the climate science demands humanity must do. For example, 
the following is a sample of votes that the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (`$VFIAX`) took
on behalf of shareholders in 2022.

| Company               | Proposal                                                                                       | Management Recommendation | `$VFIAX` Vote<sup>1</sup> |

| General Mills, Inc    | Report on Absolute Plastic Packaging Use Reduction                                             | Against                   | Against                   |
| Fedex Corporation     | Report on Climate Lobbying                                                                     | Against                   | Against                   |

## ESG is a false solution

While environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) funds aim to solve 
the above maligned corporate incentives, they're not good investment vehicles and 
don't benefit the climate as much as you'd expect or hope. 

In short, ESG is a framework that organizations implement in their corporate strategy 
to limit their negative environmental, social and governance impact. These are salient 
concerns when considering climate change, biodiversity, water management, corporate bribery, 
corruption, and more. Climate concerned opponents of ESG have raised concerns about the 
[reporting and disclosure problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance#Disclosure_and_regulation)
with ESG funds, for example. From an investing perspective ESG funds are suboptimal. 
ESG indexes are typically actively managed and require much higher administrative fees 
than their passively managed counterparts. 

The table below shows some of the most popular ESG funds and their associated cost over 
30 years of investing the maximum 401k contribution in 2022 ($22,500). 

| Fund Name                       | Ticker   | Expense Ratio | Cost over 30 years | Nest egg value after 30 years |
|---------------------------------|----------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund | `$VFTAX` | 0.14%         | $43,228            | $1,735,580                    |
| iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF | `$SUSA`  | 0.26%         | $79,334            | $1,699,475                    |
| Parnassus Core Equity Investor  | `$PRBLX` | 0.82%         | $236,895           | $1,541,913                    |
| Shelton Green Alpha Fund        | `$NEXTX` | 1.16%         | $324,364           | $1,454,444                    |

The lackluster voting record of the above ESG funds above were bimodal. The cheaper funds (Vanguard's
and BlackRock's) tended to vote poorly on climate proposals. However, more expensive and carefully 
curated funds tended to vote better for climate, but lacked exposure to some of the biggest companies 
during the shareholder voting process to make a big difference. Notably, `$NEXTX` only holds 51 companies,
roughly 1/10th of the S&P 500. 

| Company               | Proposal                                                                                       | Management Recommendation | `$VFTAX` Vote<sup>1</sup> | `$SUSA` Vote<sup>2</sup> | `$PRBLX` Vote<sup>3</sup> | `$NEXTX` Vote<sup>4</sup> |

So what avenues do we have to make sure our money isn't working against us
during shareholder votes, while also maintaining a responsible and diversified 
retirement portfolio?

## Passive funds, active investing

An exceptional balance between a responsible investment vehicle for your retirement 
nest egg and climate action is what I call "passive funds, activist investing". 
These are funds which track a pre-formulated index, such as the S&P 500, and 
simply proxy your shareholder rights in favor of climate. The two funds 
I've found which do that well are the Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund and The Engine 
No. 1 Transform 500 ETF.

### The Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund

The Sphere Fossil-Free mutual fund (`$SPFFX`) is similar to `$VFIAX` in that it seeks to track
the largest companies in the United States, but differs by opting to exclude major climate
antagonists like oil, gas, and some investor-owned utilities. It currently tracks 414 of the
top 500 stocks in the S&P 500.

Divestment from fossil fuel companies is a trend [fraught with emotion and misconceptions.](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-divestment-doesnt-work-and-just-wont-die)
Rather than viewing divestment as a viable theory of change for the energy bedrock of our
economy, Sphere chooses to view companies heavily steeped in O&G to be risky investments.
Sphere's backtraced analysis of the fund shows that the S&P 500 actually performs _better_
without fossil fuel stocks -- it yielded a 199% return over the traditional S&P 500's 178%
return between 2012 and 2022.

Unlike the above ESG funds,`$SPFFX` votes your shares in favor of climate.

| Company               | Proposal                                                                                       | Management Recommendation | `$SPFFX` Vote |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Campbell Soup Company | Assess and Report on the Company's Retirement Funds' Management of Systemic Climate Risk       | Against                   | TODO          |
| General Mills, Inc    | Report on Absolute Plastic Packaging Use Reduction                                             | Against                   | TODO          |
| Fedex Corporation     | Report on Climate Lobbying                                                                     | Against                   | TODO          |
| Tesla, Inc            | Report on Corporate Climate Lobbying in line with Paris Agreement                              | Against                   | TODO          |
| The Kroger Co.        | Report on Efforts to Eliminate HFCs in Refrigeration and Reduce GHG Emissions                  | Against                   | TODO          |
| Morgan Stanley        | Adopt Fossil Fuel Lending and Underwriting Policy Consistent with IEA's Net Zero 2050 Scenario | Against                   | TODO          |

In contrast to the Engine No. 1 fund, `$SPFFX` is a _mutual fund_. Among some other
minor differences, this means that it's ready to be invested in within company
sponsored retirement funds. Well, theoretically.

Currently, Sphere's index fund is just over a year old and has just
shy of $4MM assets under management. Many brokerages will refuse to offer funds with so
few assets; Charles Schwab will only offer funds managing $25MM or more, for
example. Guideline's 401k offerings have similar restrictions. Currently, `$SPFFX` is
offered through the Vanguard, InteractiveBrokers, US Bank, and BNY Mellon brokerages.

### The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 Index Fund

The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 ETF (`$VOTE`) is an index fund that passively tracks the
S&P 500 like `$VFIAX`, but differs in how it votes your shares. Because this fund is
passively managed it is able to offer a low 0.05% expense ratio, 1/3rd the expense ratio 
of the cheapest ESG fund mentioned above. 

Unlike the morally bankrupt shareholder votes that traditional retirement funds make,
`$VOTE`'s entire purpose is to perform virtuous activist investing. The contrast between
`$VFIAX`'s voting record and `$VOTE`'s voting record is stark. It does not proxy your 
shareholder votes exclusively on climate issues, but that is one of their most prominent 
voting criteria.

| Company               | Proposal                                                                                       | Management Recommendation | `$VOTE` Vote<sup>6</sup> |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|

| General Mills, Inc    | Report on Absolute Plastic Packaging Use Reduction                                             | Against                   | For                      |
| Fedex Corporation     | Report on Climate Lobbying                                                                     | Against                   | For                      |
| Tesla, Inc            | Report on Corporate Climate Lobbying in line with Paris Agreement                              | Against                   | For                      |
| The Kroger Co.        | Report on Efforts to Eliminate HFCs in Refrigeration and Reduce GHG Emissions                  | Against                   | For                      |
| Morgan Stanley        | Adopt Fossil Fuel Lending and Underwriting Policy Consistent with IEA's Net Zero 2050 Scenario | Against                   | Against<sup>7</sup>      |


Since `$VOTE` does not have a special index it tracks, instead opting for the largest ~500
companies in the United States, the opportunity for it to vote on really impactful proposals
_hundreds of times per year_ is not an exaggeration. Most notably, `$VOTE` shareholders placed
[three members on ExxonMobil's board](https://www.reuters.com/business/little-engine-no-1-beat-exxon-with-just-125-mln-sources-2021-06-29/)
in June 2021 in an effort to shift the corporation's trajectory to something more climate 
friendly. 

The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 fund offers a great opportunity to invest in a traditional style
fund with the ancillary benefit of _actually_ steering corporate behavior. Unfortunately, since
it's an ETF and not a mutual fund, you won't find it in any of your work sponsored retirement
plans like a 401k, 403b, of 457b.

## Closing Thoughts 

[401k assets totaled over $5.6 Trillion in 2020](https://401kspecialistmag.com/401k-assets-totaled-5-6-trillion-in-first-quarter-2020/).
Just imagine how fast we could move the largest companies in the world towards climate
solutions if we forced them to give a shit.
