# Saving for Retirement as a Form of Climate Action

## TL;DR

Consider investing your money into index funds that vote your shares for the climate. Doing so allows 
you to vote hundreds of times per year on climate issues. My two favorite funds which proxy your
shareholder rights are the [Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund](https://www.oursphere.org/the-index#?index)
(`$SPFFX`) and the [Engine No. 1 Transform 500 Fund](https://etf.engine1.com/vote/) (`$VOTE`). 
Both of these funds offer low expense ratios and roughly track the S&P 500. My personal preference 
favors `$SPFFX` over `$VOTE`. 

## Introduction

Your retirement fund choices are likely proxying your shareholder voting rights 
against corporate climate proposals _hundreds of times_ per year. Retirement fund options, like 
Vanguard's mutual funds, overwhelmingly vote how company management recommends. As you might expect, 
management recommendations are often diametrically opposed to what the climate science demands 
humanity must do. For example, the following is a sample of votes that the Vanguard 500 Index Fund 
(`$VFIAX`) took on behalf of shareholders in 2022.

| Company                            | Proposal                                                                                                | Management Recommendation | `$VFIAX` Vote<sup>1</sup> |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Alphabet Inc.                      | A stockholder proposal regarding a climate lobbying report.                                             | Against                   | Against                   |
| Citigroup Inc.                     | Stockholder proposal requesting that the Board adopt a policy to end new fossil fuel financing.         | Against                   | Against                   |
| Honeywell International Inc.       | Shareholder proposal - Climate Lobbying Report.                                                         | Against                   | Against                   |
| The Kroger Co.                     | Shareholder proposal - Report on Elimination of HFCs.                                                   | Against                   | Against                   |
| The Travelers Companies, Inc.      | Shareholder proposal relating to policies regarding fossil fuel supplies.                               | Against                   | Against                   |
| United Parcel Service, Inc.        | To require adoption of independently verified science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. | Against                   | Against                   |
| Wells Fargo & Company              | Shareholder proposal - Climate Change Policy                                                            | Against                   | Against                   |

## ESG Is a False Solution

While environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) funds aim to solve 
the above maligned corporate incentives, they're not good investment vehicles and 
don't sway corporate climate policy as much as you'd expect or hope. Climate 
concerned opponents of ESG have been raising concerns about the 
[reporting and disclosure problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance#Disclosure_and_regulation)
with ESG funds, for example. 

From an investing perspective ESG funds are suboptimal. ESG indexes are typically 
actively managed and require much higher administrative fees than their passively 
managed counterparts. The table below shows some of the most popular ESG funds 
and their associated cost over 30 years of investing the maximum 401k contribution 
in 2022 ($22,500). 

| Fund Name                       | Ticker   | Expense Ratio | Cost over 30 years | Nest egg value after 30 years |
|---------------------------------|----------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund | `$VFTAX` | 0.14%         | $43,228            | $1,735,580                    |
| iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF | `$SUSA`  | 0.26%         | $79,334            | $1,699,475                    |
| Parnassus Core Equity Investor  | `$PRBLX` | 0.82%         | $236,895           | $1,541,913                    |
| Shelton Green Alpha Fund        | `$NEXTX` | 1.16%         | $324,364           | $1,454,444                    |

The lackluster voting record of the above ESG funds above were bimodal. The cheaper funds (Vanguard's
and BlackRock's) tended to vote poorly on climate proposals. The more expensive and carefully 
curated funds tended to vote better for climate, but lacked exposure to some of the biggest companies 
during the shareholder voting process to make a big difference. Notably, `$NEXTX` only holds 51 companies,
roughly 1/10th of the S&P 500's size.

So what avenues do we have to make sure our money isn't working against us
during shareholder votes, while also maintaining a responsible and diversified 
retirement portfolio?

## Passive Funds, Active Investing

An exceptional balance between a responsible investment vehicle for your retirement 
nest egg and climate action is what I call "passive funds, activist investing". 
These are funds which track a pre-formulated index, such as the S&P 500, and 
simply proxy your shareholder rights in favor of climate. The two funds 
I've found which do that well are the Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund and The Engine 
No. 1 Transform 500 ETF.

### The Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund

The Sphere Fossil-Free mutual fund (`$SPFFX`) is similar to `$VFIAX` in that it seeks to track
the largest companies in the United States, but deviates by opting to exclude major climate
antagonists like oil, gas, and some investor-owned utilities. It currently tracks 414 of the
top 500 stocks in the S&P 500 and offers an expense ratio of 0.07%, half of the cheapest ESG
fund mentioned above. 

Divestment from fossil fuel companies is a trend [fraught with emotion and misconceptions.](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-divestment-doesnt-work-and-just-wont-die)
Rather than viewing divestment as a viable theory of change for the energy bedrock of our
economy, Sphere chooses to view companies heavily steeped in O&G to be risky investments.
Sphere's backtraced analysis of the fund shows that the S&P 500 actually performs _better_
without fossil fuel stocks -- it yielded a 199% return over the traditional S&P 500's 178%
return between 2012 and 2022.

Unlike some of the above ESG funds,`$SPFFX` votes your shares in favor of climate.

| Company                            | Proposal                                                                                                | Management Recommendation | `$SPFFX` Vote<sup>5</sup> |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Alphabet Inc.                      | A stockholder proposal regarding a climate lobbying report.                                             | Against                   | For                       |
| Citigroup Inc.                     | Stockholder proposal requesting that the Board adopt a policy to end new fossil fuel financing.         | Against                   | For                       |
| Honeywell International Inc.       | Shareholder proposal - Climate Lobbying Report.                                                         | Against                   | For                       |
| The Kroger Co.                     | Shareholder proposal - Report on Elimination of HFCs.                                                   | Against                   | For                       |
| The Travelers Companies, Inc.      | Shareholder proposal relating to policies regarding fossil fuel supplies.                               | Against                   | For                       |
| United Parcel Service, Inc.        | To require adoption of independently verified science-based greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. | Against                   | For                       |
| Wells Fargo & Company              | Shareholder proposal - Climate Change Policy                                                            | Against                   | For                       |

`$SPFFX` is a _mutual fund_ meaning it can theoretically be invested in from 
company sponsored retirement plans as well as indivial brokerages. Unfortunately, 
the fund is just over a year old and has just shy of $4MM assets under management. 
Many brokerages will refuse to offer funds with so few assets; Charles Schwab will 
only offer funds managing $25MM or more, for example. Guideline's 401k offerings have 
similar restrictions. 

Until Sphere overcomes this barrier to entry they will be available at a limited 
amount of brokerages. Currently,`$SPFFX` is offered through the Vanguard, 
InteractiveBrokers, US Bank, and BNY Mellon.

### The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 Index Fund

The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 ETF (`$VOTE`) is an index fund that passively tracks the
S&P 500 like `$VFIAX`, but differs in how it votes your shares. Because this fund is
passively managed it is able to offer a low 0.05% expense ratio, 1/3rd the expense ratio 
of the cheapest ESG fund mentioned above. 

The contrast between`$VFIAX`'s voting record and `$VOTE`'s voting record is stark. It does 
not proxy your shareholder votes exclusively on climate issues, but that is one of their 
most prominent voting criteria.

| Wells Fargo & Company         | Shareholder proposal - Climate Change Policy                                                            | Against                   | For                      |


Since `$VOTE` invests in the ~500 largest companies in the US, the opportunity for it to vote on 
really impactful proposals _hundreds of times per year_ is not an exaggeration. Most notably, 
`$VOTE` shareholders placed [three members on ExxonMobil's board](https://www.reuters.com/business/little-engine-no-1-beat-exxon-with-just-125-mln-sources-2021-06-29/)
in June 2021 in an effort to shift the corporation's trajectory to something more climate 
friendly.`$VOTE`'s theory of change differs slightly from Sphere's. It recognizes that the S&P 500
contains risky oil and gas assets, but seeks to influence corporate decision making such
that not only the climate benefits, but so do S&P 500 shareholders. 

The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 fund offers a great opportunity to invest in a traditional style
fund with the ancillary benefit of _actually_ steering corporate behavior. Unfortunately, since
it's an ETF and not a mutual fund, you won't find it in any of your workplace sponsored retirement
plans like a 401k, 403b, of 457b.

## Closing Thoughts 

[401k assets totaled over $5.6 Trillion in 2020](https://401kspecialistmag.com/401k-assets-totaled-5-6-trillion-in-first-quarter-2020/).
If even a fraction of that shareholder voting power were proxied in favor of the climate instead of 
against it, I hypothesize that we would be moving _much quicker_ on this unweildy issue. Climate 
change is such a massive problem that it can sometimes feel dizzying to think about all the possible 
solutions humanity can implement. Fortunately, index fund votes have a similar wide reach to the 
climate problem and the associated action is clear-cut: move your money.
