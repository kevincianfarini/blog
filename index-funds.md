# Saving for retirement as a form of climate action

## TL;DR

Take 10 minutes and move your money invested in stocks to index funds that vote your shares 
for the climate. My two favorite funds are the Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund (`$SPFFX`) 
and the Engine No. 1 Transform 500 Fund (`$VOTE`). Both of these funds offer a low expense 
ratio and track the S&P 500. If you bank with Vanguard, InteractiveBrokers, US Bank, or BNY 
Mellon you should probably opt for `$SPFFX` over `$VOTE`.

## Introduction

Your retirement nest egg is likely voting against the climate _hundreds of times_ per year.
Retirement fund options, like Vanguard's mutual funds, overwhelmingly vote how company
management recommends. As you might expect, management recommendations are often
diametrically opposed to what the climate science demands humanity must do. For example, 
the following are all [votes that the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (`$VFIAX`) took](https://vds.issgovernance.com/vds/#/MjAxMA==/)
on behalf of shareholders in 2022.

| Company               | Proposal                                                                                       | Management Recommendation | `$VFIAX` Vote |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|
| Campbell Soup Company | Assess and Report on the Company's Retirement Funds' Management of Systemic Climate Risk       | Against                   | Against       |
| General Mills, Inc    | Report on Absolute Plastic Packaging Use Reduction                                             | Against                   | Against       |
| Fedex Corporation     | Report on Climate Lobbying                                                                     | Against                   | Against       |
| Tesla, Inc            | Report on Corporate Climate Lobbying in line with Paris Agreement                              | Against                   | Against       |
| The Kroger Co.        | Report on Efforts to Eliminate HFCs in Refrigeration and Reduce GHG Emissions                  | Against                   | Against       |
| Morgan Stanley        | Adopt Fossil Fuel Lending and Underwriting Policy Consistent with IEA's Net Zero 2050 Scenario | Against                   | Against       |

## ESG Funds

Environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) funds aim to solve the problems 
the above maligned corporate incentives. In short, ESG is a framework that organizations
implement in their corporate strategy to limit their negative environmental, social and
governance impact. These are salient concerns when considering climate change, biodiversity,
water management, corporate bribery, corruption, and more.

Aside from the [reporting and disclosure problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental,_social,_and_corporate_governance#Disclosure_and_regulation)
with ESG funds, they are also suboptimal from an investing perspective. Generally, ESG
indexes are actively managed and require much higher administrative fees than their
passively managed counterparts. The table below shows some of the most popular ESG funds
and their associated expense ratio (the amount of money it costs to invest in an ETF
or mutual fund).

| Fund Name                       | Ticker   | Expense Ratio |
|---------------------------------|----------|---------------|
| Vanguard FTSE Social Index Fund | `$VFTAX` | 0.14%         |
| iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF | `$SUSA`  | 0.26%         |
| Parnassus Core Equity Investor  | `$PRBLX` | 0.82%         |
| Shelton Green Alpha Fund        | `$NEXTX` | 1.16%         |

Let's assume you start investing the max value for a 401K in 2022 ($22,500) for the duration
of your career (~30 years) with a 6% annual rate of return. In the worst case (`$NEXTX`, 1.16%)
your 401K would have a final value of $1.45M, and you would have spent over $324K on fund
management fees. `$VFTAX`'s expense ratio is significantly less offensive at 0.14%, which would
yield a $1.7M retirement nest egg and only $43K in management fees -- not terrible.

One glaring issue with the most favorable fund above is how Vanguard still votes your
shares in direct opposition to the ESG namesake.

| Company               | Proposal                                                                                       | Management Recommendation | `$VFTAX` Vote | `$VFIAX` Vote |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Campbell Soup Company | Assess and Report on the Company's Retirement Funds' Management of Systemic Climate Risk       | Against                   | Against       | Against       |
| General Mills, Inc    | Report on Absolute Plastic Packaging Use Reduction                                             | Against                   | Against       | Against       |
| Fedex Corporation     | Report on Climate Lobbying                                                                     | Against                   | Against       | Against       |
| Tesla, Inc            | Report on Corporate Climate Lobbying in line with Paris Agreement                              | Against                   | Against       | Against       |
| The Kroger Co.        | Report on Efforts to Eliminate HFCs in Refrigeration and Reduce GHG Emissions                  | Against                   | Against       | Against       |
| Morgan Stanley        | Adopt Fossil Fuel Lending and Underwriting Policy Consistent with IEA's Net Zero 2050 Scenario | Against                   | Against       | Against       |

So despite the belief that your hard-earned money is working towards a more sustainable
climate, we have irrefutable proof above that it's not really much different at all.
This also raises many questions for me on the validity of ESG as a viable climate
metric, but I digress.

So what avenues do we have, exactly, to make sure our money isn't working against us
during shareholder votes?

## The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 Index Fund

The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 ETF (`$VOTE`) is an index fund that passively tracks the
S&P 500 like `$VFIAX`, but differs in how it votes your shares. Because this fund is
passively managed it is able to offer a low 0.05% expense ratio. Over 30 years you'll
spend less than $16K on fund management fees.

Unlike the morally bankrupt shareholder votes that traditional retirement funds make,
`$VOTE`'s entire purpose is to perform virtuous activist investing. The contrast between
`$VFIAX`'s voting record and [`$VOTE`'s voting record](https://vds.issgovernance.com/vds/#/MTI0OTg=)
is stark. It does not proxy your shareholder votes exclusively on climate issues, but
that is one of their most prominent voting criteria.

| Company               | Proposal                                                                                       | Management Recommendation | `$VOTE` Vote        | `$VFIAX` Vote |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Campbell Soup Company | Assess and Report on the Company's Retirement Funds' Management of Systemic Climate Risk       | Against                   | For                 | Against       |
| General Mills, Inc    | Report on Absolute Plastic Packaging Use Reduction                                             | Against                   | For                 | Against       |
| Fedex Corporation     | Report on Climate Lobbying                                                                     | Against                   | For                 | Against       |
| Tesla, Inc            | Report on Corporate Climate Lobbying in line with Paris Agreement                              | Against                   | For                 | Against       |
| The Kroger Co.        | Report on Efforts to Eliminate HFCs in Refrigeration and Reduce GHG Emissions                  | Against                   | For                 | Against       |
| Morgan Stanley        | Adopt Fossil Fuel Lending and Underwriting Policy Consistent with IEA's Net Zero 2050 Scenario | Against                   | Against<sup>1</sup> | Against       |


Since `$VOTE` does not have a special index it tracks, instead opting for the largest ~500
companies in the United States, the opportunity for it to vote on really impactful proposals
_hundreds of times per year_ is not an exaggeration. Most notably, `$VOTE` shareholders placed
[three members on ExxonMobil's board](https://www.reuters.com/business/little-engine-no-1-beat-exxon-with-just-125-mln-sources-2021-06-29/)
in June 2021 in an effort to shift the corporation's trajectory to something more climate 
friendly. 

The Engine No. 1 Transform 500 fund offers a great opportunity to invest in a traditional style
fund with the ancillary benefit of _actually_ steering corporate behavior. Unfortunately, since
it's an ETF and not a mutual fund, you won't find it in any of your work sponsored retirement
plans like a 401k, 403b, of 457b.

## The Sphere Fossil-Free Mutual Fund

The Sphere Fossil-Free mutual fund (`$SPFFX`) is similar to `$VOTE` in that it seeks to track
the largest companies in the United States, but differs by opting to exclude major climate
antagonists like oil, gas, and some investor-owned utilities. It currently tracks 414 of the 
top 500 stocks in the S&P 500.

Divestment from fossil fuel companies is a trend [fraught with emotion and misconceptions.](https://www.greenbiz.com/article/why-divestment-doesnt-work-and-just-wont-die)
Rather than viewing divestment as a viable theory of change for the energy bedrock of our
economy, Sphere chooses to view companies heavily steeped in O&G to be risky investments.
Sphere's backtraced analysis of the fund shows that the S&P 500 actually performs _better_
without fossil fuel stocks -- it yielded a 199% return over the traditional S&P 500's 178%
return between 2012 and 2022.

Similar to Engine No. 1's fund, `$SPFFX` votes your shares for the climate. 

| Company               | Proposal                                                                                       | Management Recommendation | `$SPFFX` Vote | `$VFIAX` Vote |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------------|
| Campbell Soup Company | Assess and Report on the Company's Retirement Funds' Management of Systemic Climate Risk       | Against                   | TODO          | Against       |
| General Mills, Inc    | Report on Absolute Plastic Packaging Use Reduction                                             | Against                   | TODO          | Against       |
| Fedex Corporation     | Report on Climate Lobbying                                                                     | Against                   | TODO          | Against       |
| Tesla, Inc            | Report on Corporate Climate Lobbying in line with Paris Agreement                              | Against                   | TODO          | Against       |
| The Kroger Co.        | Report on Efforts to Eliminate HFCs in Refrigeration and Reduce GHG Emissions                  | Against                   | TODO          | Against       |
| Morgan Stanley        | Adopt Fossil Fuel Lending and Underwriting Policy Consistent with IEA's Net Zero 2050 Scenario | Against                   | TODO          | Against       |

In contrast to the Engine No. 1 fund, `$SPFFX` is a _mutual fund_. Among some other 
minor differences, this means that it's ready to be invested in within company 
sponsored retirement funds. Well, theoretically. 

Currently, Sphere's index fund is just over a year old and has just
shy of $4M assets under management. Many brokerages will refuse to offer funds with so
few assets; Charles Schwab will only offer funds managing $25M or more, for
example. Guideline's 401k offerings have similar restrictions. Currently, `$SPFFX` is
offered through the Vanguard, InteractiveBrokers, US Bank, and BNY Mellon brokerages.

[401k assets totaled over $5.6 Trillion in 2020](https://401kspecialistmag.com/401k-assets-totaled-5-6-trillion-in-first-quarter-2020/).
Just imagine how fast we could move the largest companies in the world towards climate
solutions if we forced them to give a shit.
